# Airbnb_France_Rshiny

**Data preparation, visualization and analysis written in R, with a Rshiny web app deployment on shinyapps.io.**

**How to use:**

* _Airbnb_Rcode_French_market.R_: The R code that prepares the data for the Rshiny app. Note: For readibility purposes, you may rather read the Markdown file "Airbnb_France_data_prep_Markdown" (available in RMarkdown and PDF formats). It prints some outputs of the R code and gives some additional explanations so that is easier to understand.
* _Airbnb_Rshiny_app.R_ : The Rshiny app structure. The file contains both the server and the UI parts. It was used to deploy the app on the website shinyapps.io. 
* _End product_: You can access it here: https://margot-marchais-maurice.shinyapps.io/Airbnb_Database_Rstudio/. Note: I use the free version of shinyapps.io website, therefore there may be some performance issues at times - especially regarding the maps. If you have troubles accessing the app, you can still refer to the preview video below to have a gist of what it is about :-)

Note: The underlying data are too large (about 700 Mo) to be hosted on Github. However, it is very easy to replicate what I have done by downloading your own datasets on http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.
